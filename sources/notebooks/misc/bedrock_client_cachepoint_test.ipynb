    "# Bedrock Client Prompt Cache Testing Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tests the `invoke_model` method in the Bedrock client (`genaiic-idp-accelerator/lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/bedrock/client.py`). It includes tests for prompt caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt caching is a powerful feature in Amazon Bedrock that significantly reduces response latency for workloads with repetitive contexts. This notebook demonstrates how to implement prompt caching for IDP prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt caching allows you to store static portions of your prompt, enabling models to:\n",
    "- Reuse cached context instead of reprocessing inputs\n",
    "- Reduce response Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) for subsequent queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Prompt Caching\n",
    "- Faster Response Times: Avoid reprocessing the same context repeatedly\n",
    "- Cost Efficiency: Potentially lower token usage by avoiding redundant processing\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: To effectively use Prompt Caching, there is a [minimum number of tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.html#prompt-caching-models) for the cache. "

Smoke cigarettes to a 23 - butt length, or to the length of the filter and overwrap plus 3 mm. if in excess of 23 -. \\n2. Base results on a test of 100 cigarettes per brand, or type, \\n3. Cigarettes to be tested will be selected on a random basis, as opposed to \"weight selection,\" \\n4. Determine particulate matter on a \"dry\" basis employing the gas chromatography method published by C. H. Sloan and B. J. Sublett in Tobacco Science 9, page 70, 1965, as modified by F. J. Schultz\\' and A. W. Spears\\' report published in Tobacco Vol. 162, No. 24, page 32, dated June 17, 1966, to determine the moisture content, \\n5. Determine and report the \"tar\" content after subtracting moisture and alkaloids (as nicotine) from particulate matter. \\n6. Report tar content to the nearest whole milligram and nicotine content to the nearest 1/10 milligrams. \\nThe Commission directed that the test cover approximately 50 of the major brands and types (many brands are sold as regular, and king size, or filter, etc.) and all brands for which any tar or nicotine statement appears on the label or in the advertising. With respect to the latter, one purpose of the test will be to determine the accuracy of such statement. Cigarettes for testing will be purchased on the open market in 50 localities throughout the United States. \\nIn determining the foregoing procedures, the Commission relied substan- tially upon a record including written presentation by interested persons and oral testimony offered at a public hearing on November 30, 1966, which was held \"to assist the Commission in determining what action, if any, should be taken in the public interest with respect to modifying or amplifying the Cambridge Filter Method. and the form in which test results should be expressed.\" At the hearing the Commission received numerous submissions re- flecting a variety of modifications of the Cambridge Filter Method that have been adopted by different groups engaged in testing cigarettes. No test can precisely duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and, within fairly wide limits, no one method can be said to be either \"right\" or \"wrong.\" The Commission considers it most important that the test results be based on a reasonable standardized method and that they be capable of being presented to the public in a manner that is readily understandable. Although minor variations may not make one testing method \"better\" than another, the public \\nyour to Mission Byown Apples a Wolfe, Lane A7h7 \\n00 \\n\\nfrom Public Health ack\\n\\nBearing FTC July hise adv\\n\\n\\n<page-number>7</page-number>\\n# PLEASE TELL US WHAT YOU THINK \\n\\nHow satisfied were you in each of the following areas: \\n\\nNeither\\n\\nVery Somewhat Satisfied Nor Somewhat\\nVery\\n Satisfied Satisfied Dissatisfied Dissatisfied Dissatisfied\\n\\n1.

Smoke cigarettes to a 23 - butt length, or to the length of the filter and overwrap plus 3 mm. if in excess of 23 -. \\n2. Base results on a test of 100 cigarettes per brand, or type, \\n3. Cigarettes to be tested will be selected on a random basis, as opposed to \"weight selection,\" \\n4. Determine particulate matter on a \"dry\" basis employing the gas chromatography method published by C. H. Sloan and B. J. Sublett in Tobacco Science 9, page 70, 1965, as modified by F. J. Schultz\\' and A. W. Spears\\' report published in Tobacco Vol. 162, No. 24, page 32, dated June 17, 1966, to determine the moisture content, \\n5. Determine and report the \"tar\" content after subtracting moisture and alkaloids (as nicotine) from particulate matter. \\n6. Report tar content to the nearest whole milligram and nicotine content to the nearest 1/10 milligrams. \\nThe Commission directed that the test cover approximately 50 of the major brands and types (many brands are sold as regular, and king size, or filter, etc.) and all brands for which any tar or nicotine statement appears on the label or in the advertising. With respect to the latter, one purpose of the test will be to determine the accuracy of such statement. Cigarettes for testing will be purchased on the open market in 50 localities throughout the United States. \\nIn determining the foregoing procedures, the Commission relied substan- tially upon a record including written presentation by interested persons and oral testimony offered at a public hearing on November 30, 1966, which was held \"to assist the Commission in determining what action, if any, should be taken in the public interest with respect to modifying or amplifying the Cambridge Filter Method. and the form in which test results should be expressed.\" At the hearing the Commission received numerous submissions re- flecting a variety of modifications of the Cambridge Filter Method that have been adopted by different groups engaged in testing cigarettes. No test can precisely duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and, within fairly wide limits, no one method can be said to be either \"right\" or \"wrong.\" The Commission considers it most important that the test results be based on a reasonable standardized method and that they be capable of being presented to the public in a manner that is readily understandable. Although minor variations may not make one testing method \"better\" than another, the public \\nyour to Mission Byown Apples a Wolfe, Lane A7h7 \\n00 \\n\\nfrom Public Health ack\\n\\nBearing FTC July hise adv\\n\\n\\n<page-number>7</page-number>\\n# PLEASE TELL US WHAT YOU THINK \\n\\nHow satisfied were you in each of the following areas: \\n\\nNeither\\n\\nVery Somewhat Satisfied Nor Somewhat\\nVery\\n Satisfied Satisfied Dissatisfied Dissatisfied Dissatisfied\\n\\n1.

Smoke cigarettes to a 23 - butt length, or to the length of the filter and overwrap plus 3 mm. if in excess of 23 -. \\n2. Base results on a test of 100 cigarettes per brand, or type, \\n3. Cigarettes to be tested will be selected on a random basis, as opposed to \"weight selection,\" \\n4. Determine particulate matter on a \"dry\" basis employing the gas chromatography method published by C. H. Sloan and B. J. Sublett in Tobacco Science 9, page 70, 1965, as modified by F. J. Schultz\\' and A. W. Spears\\' report published in Tobacco Vol. 162, No. 24, page 32, dated June 17, 1966, to determine the moisture content, \\n5. Determine and report the \"tar\" content after subtracting moisture and alkaloids (as nicotine) from particulate matter. \\n6. Report tar content to the nearest whole milligram and nicotine content to the nearest 1/10 milligrams. \\nThe Commission directed that the test cover approximately 50 of the major brands and types (many brands are sold as regular, and king size, or filter, etc.) and all brands for which any tar or nicotine statement appears on the label or in the advertising. With respect to the latter, one purpose of the test will be to determine the accuracy of such statement. Cigarettes for testing will be purchased on the open market in 50 localities throughout the United States. \\nIn determining the foregoing procedures, the Commission relied substan- tially upon a record including written presentation by interested persons and oral testimony offered at a public hearing on November 30, 1966, which was held \"to assist the Commission in determining what action, if any, should be taken in the public interest with respect to modifying or amplifying the Cambridge Filter Method. and the form in which test results should be expressed.\" At the hearing the Commission received numerous submissions re- flecting a variety of modifications of the Cambridge Filter Method that have been adopted by different groups engaged in testing cigarettes. No test can precisely duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and, within fairly wide limits, no one method can be said to be either \"right\" or \"wrong.\" The Commission considers it most important that the test results be based on a reasonable standardized method and that they be capable of being presented to the public in a manner that is readily understandable. Although minor variations may not make one testing method \"better\" than another, the public \\nyour to Mission Byown Apples a Wolfe, Lane A7h7 \\n00 \\n\\nfrom Public Health ack\\n\\nBearing FTC July hise adv\\n\\n\\n<page-number>7</page-number>\\n# PLEASE TELL US WHAT YOU THINK \\n\\nHow satisfied were you in each of the following areas: \\n\\nNeither\\n\\nVery Somewhat Satisfied Nor Somewhat\\nVery\\n Satisfied Satisfied Dissatisfied Dissatisfied Dissatisfied\\n\\n1.

Smoke cigarettes to a 23 - butt length, or to the length of the filter and overwrap plus 3 mm. if in excess of 23 -. \\n2. Base results on a test of 100 cigarettes per brand, or type, \\n3. Cigarettes to be tested will be selected on a random basis, as opposed to \"weight selection,\" \\n4. Determine particulate matter on a \"dry\" basis employing the gas chromatography method published by C. H. Sloan and B. J. Sublett in Tobacco Science 9, page 70, 1965, as modified by F. J. Schultz\\' and A. W. Spears\\' report published in Tobacco Vol. 162, No. 24, page 32, dated June 17, 1966, to determine the moisture content, \\n5. Determine and report the \"tar\" content after subtracting moisture and alkaloids (as nicotine) from particulate matter. \\n6. Report tar content to the nearest whole milligram and nicotine content to the nearest 1/10 milligrams. \\nThe Commission directed that the test cover approximately 50 of the major brands and types (many brands are sold as regular, and king size, or filter, etc.) and all brands for which any tar or nicotine statement appears on the label or in the advertising. With respect to the latter, one purpose of the test will be to determine the accuracy of such statement. Cigarettes for testing will be purchased on the open market in 50 localities throughout the United States. \\nIn determining the foregoing procedures, the Commission relied substan- tially upon a record including written presentation by interested persons and oral testimony offered at a public hearing on November 30, 1966, which was held \"to assist the Commission in determining what action, if any, should be taken in the public interest with respect to modifying or amplifying the Cambridge Filter Method. and the form in which test results should be expressed.\" At the hearing the Commission received numerous submissions re- flecting a variety of modifications of the Cambridge Filter Method that have been adopted by different groups engaged in testing cigarettes. No test can precisely duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and, within fairly wide limits, no one method can be said to be either \"right\" or \"wrong.\" The Commission considers it most important that the test results be based on a reasonable standardized method and that they be capable of being presented to the public in a manner that is readily understandable.

Determine and report the \"tar\" content after subtracting moisture and alkaloids (as nicotine) from particulate matter. \\n6. Report tar content to the nearest whole milligram and nicotine content to the nearest 1/10 milligrams. \\nThe Commission directed that the test cover approximately 50 of the major brands and types (many brands are sold as regular, and king size, or filter, etc.) and all brands for which any tar or nicotine statement appears on the label or in the advertising. With respect to the latter, one purpose of the test will be to determine the accuracy of such statement. Cigarettes for testing will be purchased on the open market in 50 localities throughout the United States. \\nIn determining the foregoing procedures, the Commission relied substan- tially upon a record including written presentation by interested persons and oral testimony offered at a public hearing on November 30, 1966, which was held \"to assist the Commission in determining what action, if any, should be taken in the public interest with respect to modifying or amplifying the Cambridge Filter Method. and the form in which test results should be expressed.\" At the hearing the Commission received numerous submissions re- flecting a variety of modifications of the Cambridge Filter Method that have been adopted by different groups engaged in testing cigarettes. No test can precisely duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and, within fairly wide limits, no one method can be said to be either \"right\" or \"wrong.\" The Commission considers it most important that the test results be based on a reasonable standardized method and that they be capable of being presented to the public in a manner that is readily understandable.

Smoke cigarettes to a 23 - butt length, or to the length of the filter and overwrap plus 3 mm. if in excess of 23 -. \\n2. Base results on a test of 100 cigarettes per brand, or type, \\n3. Cigarettes to be tested will be selected on a random basis, as opposed to \"weight selection,\" \\n4. Determine particulate matter on a \"dry\" basis employing the gas chromatography method published by C. H. Sloan and B. J. Sublett in Tobacco Science 9, page 70, 1965, as modified by F. J. Schultz\\' and A. W. Spears\\' report published in Tobacco Vol. 162, No. 24, page 32, dated June 17, 1966, to determine the moisture content, \\n5. Determine and report the \"tar\" content after subtracting moisture and alkaloids (as nicotine) from particulate matter. \\n6. Report tar content to the nearest whole milligram and nicotine content to the nearest 1/10 milligrams. \\nThe Commission directed that the test cover approximately 50 of the major brands and types (many brands are sold as regular, and king size, or filter, etc.) and all brands for which any tar or nicotine statement appears on the label or in the advertising. With respect to the latter, one purpose of the test will be to determine the accuracy of such statement. Cigarettes for testing will be purchased on the open market in 50 localities throughout the United States. \\nIn determining the foregoing procedures, the Commission relied substan- tially upon a record including written presentation by interested persons and oral testimony offered at a public hearing on November 30, 1966, which was held \"to assist the Commission in determining what action, if any, should be taken in the public interest with respect to modifying or amplifying the Cambridge Filter Method. and the form in which test results should be expressed.\" At the hearing the Commission received numerous submissions re- flecting a variety of modifications of the Cambridge Filter Method that have been adopted by different groups engaged in testing cigarettes. No test can precisely duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and, within fairly wide limits, no one method can be said to be either \"right\" or \"wrong.\" The Commission considers it most important that the test results be based on a reasonable standardized method and that they be capable of being presented to the public in a manner that is readily understandable. Although minor variations may not make one testing method \"better\" than another, the public \\nyour to Mission Byown Apples a Wolfe, Lane A7h7 \\n00 \\n\\nfrom Public Health ack\\n\\nBearing FTC July hise adv\\n\\n\\n<page-number>7</page-number>\\n# PLEASE TELL US WHAT YOU THINK \\n\\nHow satisfied were you in each of the following areas: \\n\\nNeither\\n\\nVery Somewhat Satisfied Nor Somewhat\\nVery\\n Satisfied Satisfied Dissatisfied Dissatisfied Dissatisfied\\n\\n1.
