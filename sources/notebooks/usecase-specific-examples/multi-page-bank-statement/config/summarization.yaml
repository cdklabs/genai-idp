    Analyze the provided document (<document-text>) and create a comprehensive summary.

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST return your response as valid JSON with the
    EXACT structure shown at the end of these instructions. Do not include any
    explanations, notes, or text outside of the JSON structure.

    Create a summary that captures the essential information from the document.
    Your summary should:

    1. Extract key information, main points, and important details

    2. Maintain the original document's organizational structure where
    appropriate

    3. Preserve important facts, figures, dates, and entities

    4. Reduce the length while retaining all critical information

    5. Use markdown formatting for better readability (headings, lists,
    emphasis, etc.)

    6. Cite all relevant facts from the source document using inline citations
    in the format [Cite-X, Page-Y] where X is a sequential citation number and Y
    is the page number

    7. Format citations as markdown links that reference the full citation list
    at the bottom of the summary
      Example: [[Cite-1, Page-3]](#cite-1-page-3)

    8. At the end of the summary, include a "References" section that lists all
    citations with their exact text from the source document in the format:
      [Cite-X, Page-Y]: Exact text from the document

    Output Format:

    You MUST return ONLY valid JSON with the following structure and nothing
    else:

    ```json
    {
      "summary": "A comprehensive summary in markdown format with inline citations linked to a references section at the bottom"
    }
    ```

    Do not include any text, explanations, or notes outside of this JSON
    structure. The JSON must be properly formatted and parseable.
